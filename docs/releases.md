# Releasing CARE Desktop

[Documentation index](README.md)

Releases are started manually from GitHub Actions. Do not create or push a tag
to start a build. The workflow reads the selected commit's
[`deployments/.env`](../deployments/.env), runs CI, packages the CI-built
applications, creates a tag automatically, and creates a **draft prerelease**.
Nothing is published to clinic users automatically.

Windows builds are signed through SignPath when the
[SignPath configuration](#windows-signing-signpath) is present; otherwise they
are unsigned previews. macOS retains the existing optional Developer ID signing
and notarization flow, using the same secrets listed below. Without those
credentials it retains Wails' ad-hoc signature only. The release manifest records
signing status separately for each platform. Do not tell users to disable OS
protection.

## Prepare a version

1. Create a PR updating `deployments/.env`.
2. Set `CARE_DESKTOP_VERSION` to a new numeric version, for example `0.1.1`.
   Use a new version even if only the backend, frontend, images, or deployment
   settings changed.
3. Update the dependency pins needed by that release.
4. Review the PR, let CI pass, and merge it into `main`.

| Configuration | What to maintain |
| --- | --- |
| `CARE_DESKTOP_VERSION` | One `X.Y.Z` value. `-dev` builds are not accepted by the release workflow. |
| `CARE_BE_REPO`, `CARE_FE_REPO` | The intended CARE source repositories. |
| `CARE_BE_REF`, `CARE_FE_REF` | The branch of verified CARE commits that installed clinics follow, normally `develop`. A full 40-character commit SHA pins that service instead. |
| `POSTGRES_IMAGE`, `REDIS_IMAGE`, `MINIO_IMAGE`, `CADDY_IMAGE` | Deliberately chosen image versions; use immutable digests when available. |
| `CORAZA_VERSION` | The WAF module version used to build the proxy. |
| `BACKUP_IMAGE`, `CADDY_WAF_IMAGE`, `BACKEND_IMAGE`, `FRONTEND_IMAGE` | Local output image names. These are not upstream version selectors; normally leave them alone. |

Changing these branches changes what every installed clinic follows from its
next update check onward, not only what this release ships. Only point them at
a branch whose commits are verified.

Do not add passwords, signing credentials, or clinic-specific data to this file:
the exact file is embedded in the app and attached to the release.

`deployments/.env` is the version source of truth. Do not maintain
`app/wails.json`'s `info.productVersion` by hand. The staging script synchronizes
it before native builds; a stale checked-in metadata version is not a separate
release input.

## Build the release

1. Open **Actions -> Release CARE Desktop**.
2. Select **Run workflow**, choose the approved branch (normally `main`), and
   start the run. There is no version form: the version comes from `.env`.
3. Wait for every job to finish.
4. Open the resulting draft in the repository's **Releases** page.

The workflow must be present on the default branch for the manual button to
appear. Maintainers need permission to run workflows. GitHub CLI equivalent:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main
```

All jobs use the workflow run's selected source commit, even if the branch moves
while the build is running. A matching tag is created only after packaging
succeeds. For `CARE_DESKTOP_VERSION=0.1.1`, the tag is `v0.1.1`.

## What the workflow does

| Stage | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Validate | Reject malformed/duplicate version values, moving FE/BE refs, and a version that already has a draft or published release. |
| Check and build | Call the same CI workflow used by PRs: lint, race tests, frontend checks, and real macOS/Windows native builds. No separate untested release rebuild. |
| Windows signing | With the SignPath configuration, submit the CI-built `CARE Desktop.exe` for signing, rebuild the NSIS installer around the signed file with the installer inputs CI produced, and submit the installer for signing. Each request waits for an approver. Without the configuration, both jobs are skipped and the CI installer is used unsigned. |
| macOS signing | With the existing credentials, sign the app with hardened runtime, notarize/staple it, then sign and notarize/staple the DMG. Otherwise explicitly report ad-hoc signing. |
| Package | Wrap the CI macOS app in a DMG and copy the signed (or CI-built unsigned) Windows installer. Verify macOS metadata matches the release version. |
| Record | Save the exact release configuration, source commit, workflow run URL, signing status, and SHA-256 file checksums. |
| Draft | Verify the complete asset set, create/reuse the tag at the exact source commit, and create a draft marked as a prerelease. Never replace an existing release. |

Release runs are serialized and do not cancel an active release. CI invoked by
a release has a separate concurrency group from ordinary PR/main CI.

For version `0.1.1`, the draft has these five assets:

```text
CARE-Desktop-0.1.1-macos.dmg
CARE-Desktop-0.1.1-windows-amd64-setup.exe
release-config.env
release-manifest.json
SHA256SUMS
```

The manifest's `source_commit` identifies the desktop source. The configuration
records the CARE FE/BE revisions and image pins. Checksums detect altered or
incomplete downloads; they are **not** publisher signatures or clinic TLS
certificate fingerprints.

The combined package is also retained as the `care-release-assets` workflow
artifact for 14 days. These temporary Actions artifacts are for maintainers;
the eventual published release assets are the durable downloads.

## Review and publish

Before publishing:

1. Check both installers and their checksums. Use a disposable clinic to check
   fresh setup, existing-clinic upgrade, browser access, and operation without
   internet after provisioning.
2. Add release notes describing visible changes, dependency changes, known
   limitations, and any database migration or prerequisite requirements.
3. For an existing clinic, require a verified backup before migration. Preserve
   its CA identity and persistent data; an application upgrade should not
   require all client devices to reinstall certificate trust.
4. If distributing the current preview to testers, publish it **as a
   prerelease**, retaining the unsigned-download warnings.

A draft is not public, and a prerelease is not the normal GitHub "latest stable"
download. Publishing a stable release is a separate maintainer decision.

Once published, do not move the tag or replace its files. Corrections require a
new version and another configuration PR. A database downgrade is not guaranteed
by reinstalling an older desktop binary; recovery may require a version-matched
backup.

## Failure and retry

| Failure | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Validation, CI, or packaging failed | Fix the issue. Rerun the failed job for a transient problem, or start a new run for the corrected commit. No tag/release is created before the draft job. |
| Version already has a release | Bump `.env` to a new version. Never delete a published release to reuse its version. |
| Existing tag points to another commit | Choose a new version. The workflow will not move the tag. |
| Tag created, but draft creation failed | Rerun from the same commit. A matching existing tag can be reused if no release exists. |
| Draft created, but asset upload failed | Inspect it. Delete only that incomplete, unpublished draft, retain its matching tag, and rerun from the same commit. Never publish a partial draft. |
| Tag creation rejected | Check repository tag rules and Actions permissions. Only the final job requests `contents: write`; configure repository rules to allow the intended release actor without allowing tag replacement. |

Do not restart a release from a different commit using an already reserved
version/tag. The selected commit and configuration are part of the release's
identity.

## Scope and current limitations

The process does not deploy to clinics, bundle Docker/prerequisite installers,
or prebuild the upstream CARE container images. Initial clinic setup still
needs the dependencies and source downloads described in the installation
guides. Image tags and downstream dependency downloads are not guaranteed
immutable.

A published release does reach installed clinics on its own, by two separate
routes, both described in
[clinic lifecycle](clinic-lifecycle.md) and
[configuration and settings](configuration-and-settings.md):

- **CARE backend and frontend** follow the branch named in the manifest. An
  installed clinic checks it in the background, builds the newer commit, and
  applies it when the operator accepts or at the next start. This needs no
  desktop release at all, which is the point: a verified fix merged to the
  branch reaches clinics that nobody will manually update.
- **CARE Desktop** is offered from this release page under Advanced ->
  Updates, and is always operator-initiated.

## Windows signing (SignPath)

Windows releases are signed with a certificate issued to
[SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org) under its free open-source program.
The obligations that come with it are published in the README's
[code signing policy](../README.md#code-signing-policy); keep that section
accurate when the team or the app's network behaviour changes.

### Configuration

| Setting | Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN` | secret | API token of a SignPath user with the Submitter role. |
| `SIGNPATH_ORGANIZATION_ID` | variable | SignPath organization ID. |
| `SIGNPATH_PROJECT_SLUG` | variable | SignPath project slug. |
| `SIGNPATH_SIGNING_POLICY_SLUG` | variable | Slug of the release signing policy. |

Set all four or none. A partial configuration fails the release at validation
instead of silently producing unsigned installers.

### SignPath project

- Repository `https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_desktop`, trusted build system
  GitHub.
- Artifact configuration:
  [`.github/signpath/artifact-configuration.xml`](../.github/signpath/artifact-configuration.xml).
  It signs the one PE file inside a GitHub artifact and rejects it unless product
  name, company name and product version match `app/wails.json` and the release
  version, which is the same check CI runs. Both requests use it.
- Release signing policy: origin verification on, allowed branch `main`, manual
  approval required. The workflow passes `version` as a parameter.

### During a release

1. **Sign Windows application** submits the CI-built `CARE Desktop.exe` and waits
   up to an hour for an approver.
2. **Build installer around the signed application** verifies the signature, then
   runs makensis with the installer inputs CI produced and the signed file.
3. **Sign Windows installer** submits the installer; approve that request too.
4. Packaging continues with the signed installer, and the manifest records
   `"windows": "signpath-foundation"`.

A rejected or timed-out request fails the release. Fix the cause and rerun the
same run; SignPath evaluates up to three re-runs of a build. Never submit a file
built anywhere other than this workflow.

### Before the first signed release

1. Once SignPath approves the project, create the artifact configuration and the
   signing policy there, then store the four settings above in the repository.
2. Bump `CARE_DESKTOP_VERSION`: `0.1.0` already has a tag, and versions are never
   reused.
3. Run the release workflow and approve both signing requests.
4. Check `release-manifest.json`, then publish the draft.

## Existing macOS signing configuration

No secret names, `.env` pins, bundle identifier, or application executable name
need to change:

| Existing secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MACOS_CERT_P12` | Base64-encoded Developer ID signing certificate and private key. Its presence enables macOS signing. |
| `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password used to import that PKCS#12 file. |
| `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY` | Existing Developer ID signing identity. |
| `APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY` | Existing App Store Connect API private key used by `notarytool`. |
| `APPSTORE_KEY_ID` | API key ID. |
| `APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID` | API issuer ID. |

The workflow keeps the existing `SIGN_MACOS`, `SIGNING_KEYCHAIN`, `CERT_P12`,
`CERT_PASSWORD`, `SIGN_IDENTITY`, `NOTARY_KEY`, `NOTARY_KEY_ID`, and
`NOTARY_ISSUER` environment mappings. It imports into a temporary keychain,
retains the separate submit/wait/status-check notarization flow, and validates
the stapled application and DMG. Cleanup runs even after failure.

If signing is enabled, incomplete credentials or a rejected notarization fail
the release; they do not silently produce an unsigned substitute. The job allows
up to six hours for Apple's queue, subject to the hosted runner limit.
When `MACOS_CERT_P12` is absent, the manifest explicitly says `ad-hoc`.
