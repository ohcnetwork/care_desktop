# Repository and file map

[Documentation index](README.md)

This map covers the application boundary, major internal packages, desktop
workflows and their build/test contracts. The package trees highlight principal
files rather than exhaustively listing generated output. Detailed subsystem
inventories remain in the linked guides.

`deployments/` is versioned kit source. `app/install/` is generated build staging. The clinic computer's installed kit is a third location selected by the application, not either of those checkout directories. [Facility setup](onboarding.md) and its curated datasets live in the separate `ohcnetwork/care_onboarding_fe` plugin repository.

## Application boundary: `app/*.go`

All of these files belong to Go `package main`, even though they are organized by feature.

The complete method signatures and event/result shapes are in the [Wails API reference](wails-application.md#complete-bound-method-reference). Do not infer an exported API just from a filename: Wails binds exported `App` methods, not every function in this package.

## Deployment kit

| Source | Runtime purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`deployments/.env`](../deployments/.env) | Release version, image names/bases, upstream repos and refs. |
| [`docker-compose.yml`](../deployments/docker-compose.yml) | Services, dependencies, mounts, health checks, fixed project and network identity. |
| [`backend.env`](../deployments/backend.env) | Initial CARE/backend/backup-related settings; installed copy becomes clinic-specific. |
| [`frontend.env`](../deployments/frontend.env) | Initial CARE frontend build settings; installed copy is preserved. |
| [`Caddyfile`](../deployments/Caddyfile) | HTTPS/local CA, reverse proxy, storage routes, public root bootstrap, WAF behavior. |
| [`caddy.Dockerfile`](../deployments/caddy.Dockerfile) | Builds the proxy with the Coraza module. |
| [`backup.Dockerfile`](../deployments/backup.Dockerfile) | Tools and permissions required by backup/restore helper containers. |
| [`scripts/backup.sh`](../deployments/scripts/backup.sh) | Scheduled/manual backup modes, encryption, writer locking, publication and retention. |
| [`minio/entrypoint.sh`](../deployments/minio/entrypoint.sh) | Starts Silo, waits for readiness, configures credentials and buckets under the retained storage-service identity. |

Generated public trust files and restore/build working files belong to the installed copy, not the source kit.

## Build and automation

## Navigating a change bottom-up

For a native behavior, start with its `internal/sys` package, then the calling domain/`Clinic` code, then the `App` boundary and desktop consumer. For a button-triggered behavior, follow the same path in reverse.

When source files are split or moved, keep this inventory and the owning subsystem guide synchronized. A new helper is not fully integrated until its error path, ownership, caller, and test seam are understandable from those two places.
