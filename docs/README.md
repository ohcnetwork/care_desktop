# CARE Desktop documentation

CARE Desktop is a local control application for a clinic's CARE installation. Its Go backend installs and operates a Docker Compose stack, maintains the computer's local networking, and manages encrypted backups. Wails connects that backend to the desktop control panel.

At first run, choose to host the clinic or connect to its `.local` address.
The Start screen saves no role: Server is recorded when setup initializes,
Client when connecting begins. Client discovery changes nothing on the computer.
The server operations documented here do not run on clients.

These guides cover the operator's desktop workflows and the current
implementation, from React/Wails lifecycle handling to operating-system
primitives and the deployment kit. They do not replace the CARE medical
application's own user or API documentation.

| [Releasing CARE Desktop](releases.md) | Preparing a version, how merging a version bump starts the release, reviewing and publishing the draft, signing limitations, and retrying safely. |
| [Facility setup](onboarding.md) | The CARE Onboarding frontend plugin, enabled by default for new installations, and its CARE startup requirements. |

For a first reading, follow the table from top to bottom. If you are fixing one behavior, use the task map below instead.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning in this repository |
| --- | --- |
| CARE Desktop | The Go/Wails executable and its embedded desktop control panel. |
| Desktop frontend | `app/frontend/`: the interface inside the Wails window. It is not the CARE web application. |
| CARE frontend | The separately built `care_fe` web application served to clinic staff by the Compose stack. |
| `App` | The Wails-facing object in `app/*.go`; owns application state, authorization, jobs, confirmation requests and native integrations. |
| `Clinic` | The orchestration object in `app/internal/clinic/`; operates the installed stack without importing Wails. |
| Deployment kit | The files in `deployments/`, embedded into the desktop executable and unpacked for Docker Compose. |
| Installed kit | The runtime copy of that kit on the clinic computer; distinct from source and build staging. |
| Compose project | The named set of containers, networks, and volumes belonging to `care-desktop`. |
| Named volume | Docker-managed persistent storage, separate from the desktop executable and source checkout. |
| Pin | A version, image reference, repository URL, or source commit describing what a desktop release expects. |
| Sidecar | A supporting container; here, notably the container running scheduled backups. |
| mDNS | Multicast DNS, used to advertise the clinic's `.local` name to nearby devices. |
| Root CA | The local certificate authority used to establish trust in the clinic's HTTPS certificate. |
| Backup recovery file | The exported private key required to decrypt encrypted backups. It is not encrypted with the Desktop password; keep it separate from backup data. |
| Desktop recovery code | A single-use code that resets the local Desktop password, not the CARE web login or backup encryption key. |
| Restore journal | Durable metadata used to recognize and recover an interrupted staged restore. |
| Residue | Resources left by an earlier or partially removed CARE Desktop installation. |

## How to read the diagrams

Diagrams are Mermaid code blocks inside Markdown, so there are no separate image files to keep synchronized. GitHub renders them directly. In an editor without Mermaid support, the node labels and arrows remain readable as text.

An arrow in an architecture diagram means "calls or depends on" unless stated otherwise. A flowchart describes ordering and decisions, not parallel execution. Sequence diagrams explicitly distinguish a method being accepted from its eventual completion.

## Scope and source of truth

These guides describe the code in this checkout, including the shared read lock for environment/plugin reads, staged restore recovery, plugin-load rollback and transient failed drafts, recovery-key-safe cleanup, and the Silo-backed storage service.

The implementation and these guides are the source of truth; removed design
boards and historical notes are not runtime specifications. Settings reads use
shared locks, backups use an exported recovery file rather than a password, and
restore stages replacement data instead of directly dropping the live database.

File links lead to the implementation rather than fixed line numbers. When changing a component, update its guide, affected flowcharts, and the API or file map if the contract changed. Do not treat a diagram as a substitute for error handling in the code.

## Operational caution

Running the desktop application is not a read-only demonstration: it can refresh an existing installed kit, start the clinic, and advertise its name. Setup, restore, networking repair, and removal have real effects on the current computer. Use a disposable development environment for end-to-end experiments.

For safe UI regression work, use the [Playwright test fixture](development-and-release.md#safe-desktop-ui-tests).
It requires Vite test mode and does not operate a native clinic. Ordinary
`wails dev` uses the real backend; removed design boards and preview pages are
not application entry points.

The presence of regression tests is not a claim that every operating system, power-loss scenario, or production backup has been exercised. The subsystem guides distinguish implemented recovery behavior from what their tests actually cover.
