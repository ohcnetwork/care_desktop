# Development and release

[Documentation index](README.md)

This guide explains how backend source becomes a desktop application and how that desktop application later builds the clinic. Those are separate build systems.

## The different builds

| Build | Inputs | Output | When it happens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop frontend | `app/frontend/src/`, package lock, Vite configuration | `app/frontend/dist/` | Developer or release build. |
| Desktop executable | `app/*.go`, `app/internal/`, Go dependencies, both embedded trees | Wails application under `app/build/bin/` | Developer or release build. |
| Installer/package | Wails application, platform metadata, optional signing configuration | macOS `.dmg` or Windows NSIS setup executable | Release workflow. |
| Clinic infrastructure images | Deployment Dockerfiles and base-image/module pins | Backup and Caddy/Coraza images | Clinic setup or when their inputs change. |
| CARE backend/frontend images | Pinned upstream source, generated build inputs, clinic settings/plugins | Images tagged for this clinic installation | Setup, required refresh, or explicit rebuild. |

Changing Go code, such as the settings read lock, requires rebuilding and relaunching the desktop executable. It does not require reinstalling the clinic or rebuilding every Docker image.

The control panel's "rebuild frontend" action builds the **CARE web application**, not the React interface embedded in the desktop executable.

## Source layout and tools

The Go module is [`app/go.mod`](../app/go.mod), not the repository root. It currently declares Go 1.26 and Wails v2.16.0. The desktop frontend uses npm and its checked-in [`package-lock.json`](../app/frontend/package-lock.json).

Use Node 22 for local development, matching CI and release packaging.

The direct Go dependencies have narrow jobs:

| Module | Why the backend uses it |
| --- | --- |
| `github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2` | Native application runtime, webview binding, events and dialogs at the application boundary. |
| `github.com/compose-spec/compose-go/v2` | Dotenv parsing. Stack control still goes through the Docker Compose executable, not a programmatic Compose service API. |
| `github.com/hashicorp/mdns` | DNS-SD record construction; CARE owns the interface-bound responder transport. |
| `github.com/miekg/dns` | DNS packet encoding/decoding for the responder and direct hostname probes. |
| `golang.org/x/net` | Interface-bound IPv4/IPv6 multicast sockets. |
| `golang.org/x/crypto` | Bcrypt hashing and comparison for desktop administrator authorization. |
| `golang.org/x/sys` | Low-level platform operations, including Windows durable file replacement. |

The desktop's build prerequisites are Go, Node/npm, the Wails CLI, and the native tools required by Wails on the build OS. macOS packaging uses Apple's developer tools; Windows installer creation needs NSIS (`makensis`). Docker and Git are needed for actually setting up and operating a clinic, not merely for every small Go unit test.

For a CLI version matching the current Go dependency:

```sh
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@v2.16.0
```

Use the version in `go.mod` when that dependency changes. Both CI and release
builds resolve the Wails CLI version from that module instead of installing
`@latest`.

## Prepare a fresh checkout

From the repository root:

```sh
cd app/frontend
npm ci
cd ..
wails dev
```

[`wails.json`](../app/wails.json) runs `stage-install.mjs` through its cross-platform
pre-build hook before generating bindings or compiling Go, including during
`wails dev` and development rebuilds. Missing or deleted `app/install/` is
recreated automatically, including `.env`; no manual frontend rebuild is needed.
The `npm run dev` watcher starts Vite separately.

For a normal native production build, run from the repository root:

```sh
cd app
node frontend/scripts/stage-install.mjs
wails build
```

Wails invokes the configured frontend install/build commands as part of its build workflow. Outputs go under `app/build/bin/`; platform packaging details are covered below.

A running executable does not acquire source changes or merged branches
automatically. Rebuild the desktop app to include updated retry, native folder,
or launcher behavior; rebuilding CARE's container images does not update the
desktop executable. Do not replace or close a desktop process during a retained
installation retry: that attempt exists only in that process.

When copying a Windows test executable to the visible Desktop, resolve the
Windows folder rather than assuming `$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop`:

```powershell
$desktop = [Environment]::GetFolderPath([Environment+SpecialFolder]::DesktopDirectory)
Copy-Item -LiteralPath '.\build\bin\CARE Desktop.exe' -Destination $desktop
```

Run this from `app` after building, with the destination app closed. The result
is a standalone local executable, not a signed release installer.

### A running development app has real effects

`wails dev` is not a fake bridge. It can find the current user's saved clinic configuration, refresh installed files, advertise the name, and ask the backend to start the stack. Use an isolated machine/user and Docker environment for destructive end-to-end work.

If the dev runner has stopped but its Desktop window remains open, that window
can still be running an older Go backend. Frontend refreshes do not replace it.
Fully quit that Desktop process (hiding the macOS window is not quitting), then
rerun `wails dev` from `app/` before testing backend changes. Do not run a second
independent engine against the same installed clinic while the old app can
still mutate its configuration.

Changing the repository directory does not create a separate clinic: installation paths and the Compose project identity are deliberately stable. Do not experiment with restore or uninstall against a production clinic just because the desktop executable is a development build.

### Safe desktop UI tests

The Playwright tests render the real React components with a simulated Wails
host, not a second implementation of the UI:

```sh
cd app/frontend
npm run test:ui
```

If Playwright reports that Chromium is missing, install its browser with
`npx playwright install chromium`. Dependencies belong in the checked-in
manifest/lockfile; do not add a separate preview framework.

[`playwright.config.ts`](../app/frontend/playwright.config.ts) owns a loopback
Vite server at `127.0.0.1:41783`, starts it with `--mode test --strictPort`, and
does not reuse an existing server. Its entry is
`tests/fixtures/index.html`; the fixture throws unless both Vite development
mode and the explicit test mode are active. Ordinary `npm run dev` does not
install a fake bridge, and the production entry does not import the fixture.
There is no public preview page or design-board server to launch.

[`host.ts`](../app/frontend/tests/fixtures/host.ts) provides explicit test
scenarios, bridge-call recording, held/rejected requests and emitted native
events through `window.careTest`. It never runs installers, alters trust or
networking, restores records, or removes a clinic. Keep it test-only; never add
production fallbacks that report simulated native success.

Use the smallest related group while changing a feature:

```sh
cd app/frontend
npm run test:ui -- tests/lifecycle.spec.ts tests/install.spec.ts
npm run test:ui -- tests/backups.spec.ts -g 'handoff|restore'
```

| Test file | Main coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `start-screen.spec.ts` | No premature role persistence, update phases, navigation, keyboard focus and window sizes. |
| `onboarding.spec.ts` | Client discovery/connection, setup prerequisites, recovery exports, Review and native acceptance gates. |
| `install.spec.ts` | Actual log milestones, indeterminate progress, no-log warning and failure/retry behavior. |
| `lifecycle.spec.ts` | Permission/quit requests, stale IDs, single-flight answers, paired setup/uninstall completion and global update guards. |
| `panel.spec.ts` | Overview, Storage, requirements, mobile QR and truthful status/error handling. |
| `backups.spec.ts` | Policy/destination, restore consent, cancellation and stale selections across updates. |
| `advanced.spec.ts` | Fixed 15-minute unlock, tab-leave clearing, passwords/recovery and safe environment editing. |
| `plugins.spec.ts` | Catalog/custom validation, typed settings, save/apply outcomes, failed-batch tab discard, successful-list retention, recovery controls, and update/job exclusion. |

The suite checks layouts at 1100 by 700 and 720 by 560. Failure traces go to the
ignored `app/frontend/test-results/` directory. Browser tests are evidence of UI
and bridge-contract behavior, not proof that native elevation, an external
installer or a real clinic restore succeeded. Use an isolated native environment
for those checks and state that distinction in review notes.

## Embedding pipeline

The frontend's current `build` script is:

```text
stage-install.mjs
    -> check-bindings.mjs
    -> TypeScript
    -> Vite production build
    -> prune-fonts.mjs
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Kit["deployments/ source kit"] --> Stage["stage-install.mjs"]
    Stage --> Install["app/install/ including .env"]
    Types["Go App methods and wails.d.ts"] --> Check["check-bindings.mjs"]
    TS["Desktop TypeScript and React"] --> TSC["TypeScript"]
    Check --> TSC
    TSC --> Vite["Vite with relative asset base"]
    Vite --> Prune["prune-fonts.mjs"]
    Prune --> Dist["app/frontend/dist/"]
    Install --> Go["Go embed and Wails build"]
    Dist --> Go
    Go --> App["Desktop executable"]
    App --> Refresh["Runtime installed-kit refresh"]
```

### `stage-install.mjs`

The script derives `app/wails.json`'s numeric installer version from
`CARE_DESKTOP_VERSION` in `deployments/.env` (stripping `-dev` for local builds).
Run it before invoking Wails for production builds, as Wails reads its metadata
before its pre-build hook. CI does this explicitly.

It then enumerates `deployments/`, including `.env`, rather than keeping a second manual file list. It skips `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, and `.gitkeep`, clears previous staging entries while retaining the tracked placeholder, and copies the kit recursively.

Wails runs pre-build hooks from `app/build/bin/`, so its hook invokes
`node ../../frontend/scripts/stage-install.mjs`. The script resolves source and
destination paths relative to itself, not the working directory. The standalone
`npm run build` command also stages the kit.

This is **build staging**, not runtime installation. Clearing `app/install/` does not remove the user's installed directory.

Always edit `deployments/` for a kit change. Editing `app/install/` would be overwritten by the next build and would not be the versioned source of truth.

### Placeholders and `go build`

`app/install/.gitkeep` and `app/frontend/dist/.gitkeep` keep the Go embed patterns valid in a clean checkout. Their presence allows compilation; it does not create a usable deployment kit or desktop UI.

`NewApp` explicitly rejects a build whose embedded kit lacks `.env`. A plain Go compilation of placeholders is therefore a useful compile check, not a substitute for the complete Wails/frontend build.

### Desktop assets

[`vite.config.ts`](../app/frontend/vite.config.ts) uses `base: "./"` so the asset URLs work under the Wails asset server. Its small `keep-dist` plugin restores the tracked placeholder after Vite clears the output directory.

[`prune-fonts.mjs`](../app/frontend/scripts/prune-fonts.mjs) removes emitted `.woff`, `.ttf`, and `.svg` files from `dist/assets`, retaining WOFF2. The script works by extension, so changes to emitted asset types should account for that behavior rather than assume it parses font manifests.

## Wails contract maintenance

The active desktop declarations are [`wails.d.ts`](../app/frontend/src/wails.d.ts), with data shapes in [`types.ts`](../app/frontend/src/types.ts). The runtime access layer is [`bridge.ts`](../app/frontend/src/lib/bridge.ts).

Wails-generated `frontend/wailsjs/` files are ignored and regenerated. They are not a replacement for keeping the declarations actually used by this desktop interface synchronized.

[`check-bindings.mjs`](../app/frontend/scripts/check-bindings.mjs) reads the declared `App` block and exported Go receiver methods. It checks that each declared method exists and accepts the same number of parameters. It does not prove argument types, return shapes, authorization, or event semantics.

For a contract-only change, the existing focused checks are:

```sh
cd app/frontend
./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
node scripts/check-bindings.mjs
```

These checks do not stage the kit or build a release.

For changed native consent or setup contracts, the existing focused suite can
run without real elevation:

```sh
cd app
go test -race . -run 'Test(Confirmation|Onboarding|.*Recovery)'
golangci-lint run --timeout=5m
```

The repository's [pre-commit configuration](../.pre-commit-config.yaml) also
checks YAML, file endings and whitespace, formats changed Go files, and runs
package-wide `golangci-lint --fix`. Inspect any hook edits and rerun affected
checks before committing; do not bypass a failed hook to claim completion.
Changes to the root store, global dialogs or update controller warrant the full
UI suite because all screens share them.

## Release identity and pins

[`deployments/.env`](../deployments/.env) is the common release manifest consumed by Compose, Go, and packaging. [`release.Load()`](../app/internal/release/pins.go) parses it using dotenv and requires the following non-empty values:

| Group | Required keys |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop identity | `CARE_DESKTOP_VERSION`. |
| Third-party bases | `POSTGRES_IMAGE`, `REDIS_IMAGE`, `MINIO_IMAGE`, `CADDY_IMAGE`, `CORAZA_VERSION`. |
| Built-image names | `BACKUP_IMAGE`, `CADDY_WAF_IMAGE`, `BACKEND_IMAGE`, `FRONTEND_IMAGE`. |
| CARE sources | `CARE_BE_REPO`, `CARE_FE_REPO`, `CARE_BE_REF`, `CARE_FE_REF`. |
| Prerequisite installers | `RANCHER_VERSION`, `RANCHER_MACOS_ARM64_SHA256`, `RANCHER_MACOS_X86_64_SHA256`, `RANCHER_WINDOWS_SHA256`, `GIT_WINDOWS_VERSION`, `GIT_WINDOWS_SHA256`, `DOCKER_LINUX_VERSION`, `DOCKER_LINUX_X86_64_SHA256`, `DOCKER_LINUX_AARCH64_SHA256`, `COMPOSE_LINUX_VERSION`, `COMPOSE_LINUX_X86_64_SHA256`, `COMPOSE_LINUX_AARCH64_SHA256`. |

The version format is `X.Y.Z` or `X.Y.Z-dev`. `RANCHER_VERSION`,
`DOCKER_LINUX_VERSION`, and `COMPOSE_LINUX_VERSION` are `X.Y.Z`,
`GIT_WINDOWS_VERSION` is `X.Y.Z.windows.N`, and each `*_SHA256` is 64 lowercase
hex characters; see [pinned prerequisite downloads](native-integrations.md#pinned-prerequisite-downloads).

`CARE_BE_REF` and `CARE_FE_REF` name the **branch** a release follows, not a
commit. Releases normally track `develop`: a branch of verified commits, so
bug fixes reach installed clinics without a desktop release. An installed
clinic resolves that branch to a commit once, records it, and only moves
forward when a background check has already built the newer commit. A full
40-character commit ID is still accepted and opts that service out of
following the branch. A tag is not accepted, and a ref that resolves to
nothing fails the build rather than being passed along as if it were a commit.
See [clinic lifecycle](clinic-lifecycle.md) for how a
resolved commit is chosen, staged, and applied.

At runtime, `GetState().version` comes from these embedded pins, not a separate
linker-injected version variable.

Releases derive their identity from the commit that started them (the merge
into `main`, or the commit selected for a manual run):

| Source | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| `CARE_DESKTOP_VERSION` | Numeric `X.Y.Z`, without `-dev`. |
| `app/wails.json` -> `info.productVersion` | Derived as `X.Y.Z` before building. |
| Automatically created tag | `vX.Y.Z`, pointing to the workflow's source commit. |
| CARE backend and frontend refs | A branch name to follow, or a full commit hash to pin. |

The workflow rejects missing/duplicate manifest identity values, an existing
release version, and any pinned prerequisite whose download is missing or whose
SHA-256 differs before building installers. Maintainers do not need to edit
Wails metadata or create tags. See the [release runbook](releases.md) for preparing,
building, reviewing, publishing, and recovering a release.

### Testing the updater

A `-dev` build compares as older than the published release of the same `X.Y.Z`, so a development install can exercise the desktop updater against a real release rather than a fixture.

Build tests use local Git fixtures rather than the real CARE repository URLs. Resolving a branch runs `git ls-remote`, and a unit test that reaches GitHub is slow, flaky, and on a machine with a credential helper installed will ask the developer for a password.

For the same reason no test may elevate. Privileged work goes through [`sys/elevate`](../app/internal/sys/elevate/elevate.go), which runs `osascript` on macOS and `pkexec` elsewhere, so a test that calls it puts a real password dialog in front of whoever ran `go test` and fails on CI, where no one can answer it. Faking the command on `PATH` is not enough, because `elevate` picks the command by platform and the Windows path is the one those tests describe. `netfix` therefore exposes its elevation as a package variable that tests replace, and asserts on the script it was handed; the elevated wrapper around that script is covered separately in `elevate`'s own tests, where it is only a string.

### Reproducibility boundaries

A release no longer fixes which CARE commit a clinic runs; the tracked branch does, and installed clinics move forward with it. What a given clinic is running is recorded in its `channel.lock` and stamped into each image's `built-from` label, so an install can always be asked rather than assumed. Image fingerprints also include build inputs, as explained in [clinic lifecycle](clinic-lifecycle.md).

This is a deliberate trade: branch tracking is what lets a verified fix reach clinics that nobody will manually update, and it is only safe because the branch admits verified commits only. Pinning a commit in `deployments/.env` remains available for a release that must not move.

An image tag is not an immutable registry digest, however, and build-time package downloads can have their own availability and reproducibility constraints. "Pinned source" should not be expanded into a claim that every external dependency is content-addressed forever.

The current storage image pin points to Silo while the key remains `MINIO_IMAGE`. Do not rename the Compose service or data volume as a routine pin update.

## CI

[`ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on pull requests, pushes to `main`,
merge-queue groups, manual dispatch, and reusable calls from the release workflow.
A newer run cancels the previous run
for the same PR/ref. There are no path filters that could leave a required check
missing, and a PR branch push does not trigger a duplicate push workflow.

| Job/check | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Lint | Formatting, the Wails/internal boundary, pinned Actionlint workflow validation, and golangci-lint v2.13.2 through its v9 action. |
| Go tests | Clean-checkout `go build ./...` and the full race-enabled test suite, including the release identity/CI gate contracts. Node, PostgreSQL fixture tools, OpenSSL, Python, Git, and Compose must be available rather than silently skipping their tests. |
| Frontend | Node 22, `npm ci`, binding checks, TypeScript, and the Vite production build. Uploads the built frontend for native builds. |
| Native builds | After the first three jobs pass: actual Wails macOS universal and Windows/amd64 builds for CARE Desktop. Windows must produce an NSIS installer with NSIS 3.12 from [`install-nsis`](../.github/actions/install-nsis/action.yml), and its version metadata must match `wails.json` and `.env`; the bare application and the generated installer inputs are uploaded separately so a release can sign the application before rebuilding the installer. |
| CI | Stable aggregate check; fails if any required job failed, was cancelled, or was skipped. Configure this check in branch protection. |

Go comes from `app/go.mod`, and module writes are disallowed. Native jobs reuse
the frontend artifact rather than running npm for each platform. They use the
Wails CLI version from `go.mod`, production build flags, and real platform
dependencies. The Desktop pre-build hook still
stages the deployment kit before embedding it.

[`app/.golangci.yml`](../app/.golangci.yml) keeps `errcheck`, `govet`,
`ineffassign`, `staticcheck`, `unused`, `bodyclose`, and `misspell`. Staticcheck
exempts public API documentation rules for these internal application packages
and ST1005 for operator-facing sentence-style errors. Correctness checks are
not disabled to make CI pass.

CI has read-only repository permissions, no signing secrets, explicit timeouts,
and seven-day **unsigned** build artifacts. macOS bundles are zipped with
`ditto` to retain executable bits and symlinks. These are maintainer preview
builds, not clinic-ready signed releases. The intermediate frontend artifact is
kept for one day.

The Go suite runs on Linux. Native builds prove compilation and packaging on the
other platforms, not successful administrator prompts, certificate installation,
browser trust, or real clinic Wi-Fi behavior. Network mDNS tests remain opt-in.
PostgreSQL tests create an isolated fixture; CI does not start the clinic's
Compose stack, build upstream CARE images, or contact a production database.

Local equivalents for the portable checks:

```sh
actionlint -shellcheck="" -pyflakes=""
cd app
golangci-lint run --timeout=5m
go test -mod=readonly -race -count=1 -timeout=15m ./...
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
```

Use Actionlint v1.7.12 and golangci-lint v2.13.2, matching CI. Actionlint checks
workflow syntax and expressions; it does not invoke ShellCheck or Pyflakes.
Database/Compose tests need the same local prerequisites as the Go job.

### Pre-commit fixes

The repository includes [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for the
auto-fixable checks: trailing whitespace, final newlines, YAML syntax, Go
formatting, and golangci-lint fixes. They use the same golangci-lint version
and configuration as CI; package-wide linting runs from `app/`, not just on
the staged Go files.

Install pre-commit with your preferred package manager (for example,
`uv tool install pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`), then install the
hooks and the CI-matching Go linter once from the repository root:

```sh
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.13.2
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Run `pre-commit run --all-files` after installing it, or rerun `git commit`
after a hook changes files and stage those changes. The hooks intentionally do
not replace CI's race tests, frontend production build, Actionlint validation,
or native application builds.

## Regression-test organization

Tests sit beside their packages. They use Go's standard test runner and existing runtime tools, rather than a separate end-to-end testing framework.

| Area | Representative coverage |
| --- | --- |
| App/settings | Shared authenticated reads, write exclusion, lifecycle guards, and retention persistence. |
| Clinic | Domain rewriting, worker-stop/migration ordering, native-access outcomes, cleanup ownership, and backup script behavior. |
| Backup | Encryption/key handling, staged restore control flow, archive validation, and interruption recovery. |
| Compose | Build freshness, image inputs, deployment routing, and storage bootstrap contracts. |
| Native helpers | Process handling, atomic replacement, elevation quoting, hosts/trust parsing, mDNS, and Windows networking. |
| Prerequisites/residue | Bounded provisioning paths and truthful resource inspection with isolated fixtures. |
| Release | Manifest validation, source ref syntax, installer-version agreement, and the workflow's identity validator. |

Some integration tests require external executables or have platform/user restrictions; a skipped case is not a successful production restore. Read the package test and the subsystem guide before running those fixtures.

For the shared settings behavior, a targeted invocation is:

```sh
cd app
go test -mod=readonly -race . ./internal/plugins
```

For another change, select the package/test covering that behavior first. The full CI suite exists, but is not necessary for every documentation or single-package edit. Avoid running native-changing integration tests on a machine that holds the only copy of clinic data.

## Packaging and publication

The release workflow runs when a push to `main` changes `CARE_DESKTOP_VERSION`
in `deployments/.env`, or when started by hand, and reuses the native artifacts
built by CI in the same workflow run:

| Platform | Wails target | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `darwin/universal` | `CARE-Desktop-X.Y.Z-macos.dmg`. |
| Windows | `windows/amd64` with `-nsis` | `CARE-Desktop-X.Y.Z-windows-amd64-setup.exe`. |

Linux has backend/native helper implementations but no published desktop installer.

The workflow packages a DMG and the Windows NSIS installer, adds the exact
configuration, build identity, and checksums, creates `vX.Y.Z` at the selected
source commit, and creates a **draft prerelease**. Published assets are never
replaced. Only the draft job has write permission.

macOS preserves the existing optional Developer ID signing/notarization flow and
secret names; without credentials it retains Wails' ad-hoc signature. Windows
application, uninstaller and installer are signed through SignPath when its configuration is
present, otherwise left unsigned. The release manifest records each platform's
actual status; these remain preview releases.

The Windows installer definition lives in `app/build/windows/` (`info.json`,
`wails.exe.manifest`, `installer/project.nsi`). Wails regenerates `icon.ico`,
`installer/wails_tools.nsh` and the WebView2 bootstrapper from `wails.json` and
its own module on every build, so those are ignored.

Follow [Releasing CARE Desktop](releases.md) for the complete maintainer procedure
and safe retry rules.

### In-place desktop updates

`app_update.go`, `app_selfupdate.go`, and `app_update_helpers.go` implement the
desktop updater independently of CARE's container/image updates. Releases keep
the existing DMG and NSIS assets and `SHA256SUMS`; no additional executable helper
or unsigned remote script is downloaded. Locally generated helpers wait for the
desktop process to exit, replace the installed application, and reopen it.

macOS extracts and verifies the bundle before handoff, then stages a complete
copy beside the current bundle before renaming it. Windows releases must retain
the `/S /CAREUPDATE=1 /D=<existing directory>` path in `project.nsi`: it stages
the new executable, keeps the previous one until replacement succeeds, and does
not run the uninstaller or reinstall prerequisites. `/D` must be last and must
not be quoted (NSIS consumes the remaining command line, including spaces).
The update branch intentionally keeps the existing uninstaller and shortcuts.
Both the ordinary and signed-uninstaller packaging variants use this same path.

SHA-256 remains download integrity, not independent publisher authentication.
Ad-hoc macOS and unsigned Windows preview releases remain supported. An
installation with a macOS signing team cannot change teams or downgrade to
ad-hoc signing; Gatekeeper must approve its replacement. A valid Authenticode
installation requires a valid installer with the same publisher subject.
Certificate/publisher migrations need a separately reviewed migration, not a
relaxed updater check. No quarantine-removal command is used.

Before publishing, test upgrades **on disposable installed copies**, including
custom paths and spaces, writable and administrator-owned macOS folders,
and a root-owned macOS bundle inside an admin-group-writable `/Applications`
(ownership preservation must still request administrator permission),
cancelled elevation/UAC, corrupt downloads, full disks, Windows file locks,
failed final replacement, and relaunch failure. Confirm the old copy survives
failed replacement and the clinic remains running. Test signed-to-signed and
unsigned preview paths separately. Bare executables, `-dev` builds, and macOS
DMG/translocated copies must refuse in-place updating instead of opening a disk
image and claiming success. Installation from a DMG is still required once.
An older installed version keeps its old updater until this release is installed.

Targeted tests: Go tests named `TestDesktopUpdate`, `TestDownload`, `TestSwap`,
`TestMacUpdateHelper`, `TestWindowsUpdateHelper`, and `TestUpdateHelper`; frontend
`tests/app-updater.spec.ts` and updater cases in `tests/start-screen.spec.ts`.
These exercise fixture downloads, helper generation/startup errors, local
fixture-bundle swaps/rollback, and UI handoff guards. They do **not** establish
real Windows UAC/locking behavior, Gatekeeper authorization, or native relaunch
success; native upgrade acceptance remains required.

## Maintainer change map

| Change | Surfaces to update together |
| --- | --- |
| Wails method or result shape | Go method/JSON tags, `wails.d.ts`, `types.ts`, call sites, API guide. |
| Long-running job behavior | `run()` contract, lifecycle guards, event consumers, progress-message expectations. |
| Environment setting | Installed-file semantics, schema if exposed, appropriate apply/rebuild path, configuration guide. |
| Image/build input | Release pin or builder input, freshness calculation, deployment contract and relevant tests. |
| Restore sequence | Journal/state recovery, staging cleanup, worker callbacks, interruption cases, restore diagrams. |
| Native resource identity | Creation, inspection, cleanup, residue classification, platform-specific tests. |
| Kit file | `deployments/` source, readers/mounts, staging/runtime preservation assumptions, file map. |
| Release version | `deployments/.env`; build metadata and tags are derived. Update release documentation if behavior changes. |

Keep code and diagrams synchronized. A documentation-only change does not require rebuilding CARE Desktop.
